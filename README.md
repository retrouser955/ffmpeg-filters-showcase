# FFMPEG Filters showcase

A project made with [`@ffmpeg/ffmpeg`](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app) (FFMPEG WASM) and filters from [`discord-player`](https://discord-player.js.org). Quickly encode audio without uploading to an external server!

## Running Locally

Run these commands!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/retrouser955/ffmpeg-filters

> cd ffmpeg-filters
> yarn

> yarn dev
```

### Side note

*I speed ran the creation of this web app so the code and the UI is very VERY bad. I might fix it later though*
